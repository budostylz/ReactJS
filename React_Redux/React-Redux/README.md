## Getting the Store to Each Component
The first thing we want to do is improve how each component gets access to the store. If it's tough for a component to access the store, whether it's to get the state, listen to the state, or update the state, nothing else we do will matter. Right now weâ€™re just passing the store down as a prop. It works fine enough in our small app, but what if we had a larger app with more layers to it? Passing the store down ten components deep wouldn't scale very well. One of the main points of having a store is to avoid passing props down through a bunch of components.

One reason React (talking about React for a moment, not Redux) is so popular is because it's very efficient. It's efficient in keeping state localized to a component, it's efficient in keeping UI confined to a component, and it's efficient in knowing when something has changed and re-rendering just that component. So the second thing we need need to figure out is how to re-render components only if the data they depend on (from the store) changes. Right now, we're solving this by calling getState at the root of our application and then passing the data down. Again, this won't scale well as our app grows.

If we can find a nice abstraction for getting the store to any component that needs it and only re-rendering components when the exact data they need change, we'll improve every aspect of our current codebase.

## Context
Before we add the Context API into our app, let's make sure we're on the same page as to how it all works.

Recall that in one of the previous screencasts, passing data from one component to another component was a bit cumbersome. We had to pass data from component to component:

        import React from 'react';
        import { render } from 'react-dom';

        function Parent ({ name }) {
                return (
                <div>
                <h1>Parent</h1>
                <Child name={name}/>
                </div>
                );
        }

        function Child ({ name }) {
                return (
                <div>
                <h1>Child</h1>
                <Grandchild name={name}/>
                </div>
                );
        }

        function Grandchild ({ name }) {
                return (
                <div>
                <h1>Grandchild</h1>
                <h3>Name: {name}</h3>
                </div>
                );
        }

        class App extends React.Component {
        render() {
        const name = 'Tyler';

        return (
                <Parent />
                );
                }
        }

        render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

The App component renders Parent, which renders Child, which renders Grandchild. However, what's important to notice here is that the Grandchild component wants to render name -- but the data for name lives inside the App component.

Because Grandchild is so deeply nested, we have to pass the name prop one-by-one from App through all the components until it reaches Grandchild. What's more: we must do this even if any of the components along the way (Parent and Child) aren't even concerned with the name data!

This process of "threading props" to send data to a child component can be tiresome, and perhaps even error-prone. Luckily, we can avoid it with React's Context API. To begin, we'll use React's createContext() function to return an object with a Provider as well as a Consumer.

        const Context = React.createContext();

Let's now check out how Context.Provider and Context.Consumer make these interactions between components possible!

## Context.Provider
The Provider component is used in the upper level of the component tree; that is, the component from which the data to be passed is held. In our case, this was the App component. We passed the name data as the value of Provider's value prop:

        class App extends React.Component {
                render() {
                const name = 'Tyler';

                return (
                <Context.Provider value={name}>
                <Parent />
                </Context.Provider>
                );
                }
        }
Note that the Provider component simply wraps around the entire component to be rendered!

## Context.Consumer
On the receiving end (i.e., a component "under" the Provider in the component hierarchy), we use the Consumer component. In our example, we passed Consumer a function as a child. This function accepts a value and returns some JSX:

                function Grandchild ({ name }) {
                        return (
                        <Context.Consumer>
                        {(name) => (
                        <div>
                        <h1>Grandchild</h1>
                        <h3>Name: {name}</h3>
                        </div>
                        )}
                        </Context.Consumer>
                        );
                }
As a result, we were able to render the Grandchild component with the correct name data without ever having to pass that data down the entire component thread! That's a lot less code than the previous way we had to do it. So React's Context API provides a terse, approachable way to easily communicate information from one component to another.

Now, let's go ahead and utilize Context in our todos app.

We just built out the Provider, Context, and connect() function. This function is so common that it has been developed into a library called react-redux that's officially supported by React.

We'll be adding the react-redux library in the following video:

                <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-redux@5.0.6/dist/react-redux.min.js"></script>

## The react-redux Bindings
Let's take a moment to recap the changes we've made to our app in this Lesson, because we've updated quite a bit!

Previously, we leveraged the standard redux library to build our app. This allowed us to create a Redux store with the createStore() function, giving us an API to listen (subscribe()), get updates (getState()), and make updates (dispatch()) to state. We then created our own Provider component to efficiently pass the store to components that needed it, as well as our own connect() function so that our components can access "slices" of state as props.

We can build a fully-functional React and Redux app without Provider or connect(), but since they greatly simplify how React components interact with the Redux store, the creators of redux have included them in the react-redux package!

## Provider
With react-redux, rather than creating and using our own Provider which looks like this:

const Context = React.createContext()    

                class Provider extends React.Component {    
                render () {    
                return (    
                <Context.Provider value={this.props.store}>    
                {this.props.children}    
                </Context.Provider>    
                );
                }    
                }

                ReactDOM.render(
                <Provider store={store}>
                <ConnectedApp />
                </Provider>,
                document.getElementById('app')
                );

...we can simply use the Provider component defined by the react-redux package! This allows us to wrap our entire app with Provider, effectively passing the store to even the most deeply nested components.

                ReactDOM.render(
                <ReactRedux.Provider store={store}>
                <ConnectedApp />
                </ReactRedux.Provider>,
                document.getElementById('app')
                );
## connect()
Similarly, we can also leverage react-redux's connect() function right out of the box. connect() is a higher-order function that takes in two arguments (as well as a few optional arguments) and returns a function. Check out its signature below:

                const buildConnectedComponent = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps);
What's vital to understand is that buildConnectedComponent is a function. buildConnectedComponent will take a regular (presentational) React component and return a new, "connected" component.

                const ConnectedComponent = buildConnectedComponent(MyComponent);
ConnectedComponent renders MyComponent, passing it the props as defined by mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToPros.

We can avoid having the intermediary buildConnectedComponent variable and just call the functions back-to-back:

                const ConnectedComponent = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MyComponent)
