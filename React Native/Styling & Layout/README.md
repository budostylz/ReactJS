# CSS in JS
Before we jump into how CSS in JavaScript works, let's check out an example of some "normal" HTML and CSS:

<a href="https://expo.github.io/vector-icons/" >Platform Icons</a>

```javascript
        <!-- index.css -->
        .avatar {
            border-radius: 5px;
            margin: 10px;
            width: 48px;
            height: 48px;
        }

        <!-- // index.html -->
        <div>
            <img class='avatar' src='https://tylermcginnis.com/tylermcginnis_glasses-300.png' />
        </div>

        Nothing too surprising! But since we're not using HTML or CSS files to build mobile apps -- how would this look in React Native?

        First, it important to know that all of the core components in React Native can accept a prop named style. One way we can leverage this prop is to provide styling to components with inline JavaScript objects:


        function Avatar ({ src }) {
            return (
                <View>
                    <Image
                        style={{borderRadius: 5, margin: 10, width: 48, height: 48}}
                        source={{uri: 'https://tylermcginnis.com/tylermcginnis_glasses-300.png'}}
                    />
                </View>
                );
            }
```

In the example above, the <Image> component receives two props: style and source. The value of style is just a plain old JavaScript object with borderRadius, margin, width, and height properties. Keep in mind that unlike CSS on the web, properties are written in camelCase (i.e., borderRadius in CSS in JS, but border-radius on the web).

This works, but things can get muddy quickly. Imagine if the inline object contained a dozen properties, or if we wanted the same style to apply to more than just one component! One way to keep your code DRY and reusable is to store the object in a variable:

```javascript
        const styles = {
            image: {
                borderRadius: 5,
                margin: 10,
                width: 48,
                height: 48
            }
        };

        function Avatar ({ src }) {
        return (
            <View>
            <Image
                style={styles.image}
                source={{uri: 'https://tylermcginnis.com/tylermcginnis_glasses-300.png'}}
            />
            </View>
        );
        }

It's a great way to clean things up a bit, but React Native goes a step further with its StyleSheet API. Check out the following example:

        import React from 'react';
        import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';

        export default class TextExample extends React.Component {
        render() {
            return (
            <View>
                <Text style={styles.greenLarge}>This is large green text!</Text>
                <Text style={styles.red}>This is smaller red text!</Text>
            </View>
            );
        }
        }

        const styles = StyleSheet.create({
            greenLarge: {
                color: 'green',
                fontWeight: 'bold',
                fontSize: 40
            },
            red: {
                color: 'red',
                padding: 30
            },
        });
```

Here, an object containing styles is passed into StyleSheet's create method. It looks similar to styling with a JavaScript object variable! However, using StyleSheet gives us a few benefits in terms of code quality and performance. We‚Äôll take a closer look later in this Lesson as well, but this is how the React Native docs describe it:

Code quality

* By moving styles away from the render function, you're making the code easier to understand.
* Naming the styles is a good way to add meaning to the low-level components in the render function.

Performance

* Making a stylesheet from a style object makes it possible to refer to it by ID instead of creating a new style object every time.
* It also allows to send the style only once through the bridge. All subsequent uses are going to refer to an id (not implemented yet).

Another benefit is that StyleSheet validates the content within the style object as well. This means that should there be any errors in any properties or values in your style objects, the console will throw an error during compilation instead of at runtime.

üí° Additional Stylingüí°
If you wanted to implement more than one style to a component, the style prop can accept styles as an array:

        <Text style={[styles.red, styles.greenLarge]}>This will be red, then greenLarge</Text>

The above <Text> component will render large green text, as the last style in the array will take precedence. This is a great way to inherit styles!

üí° Libraries for CSS in JSüí°
Styling in React is going through a renaissance period right now just as Flux did a few years ago (which eventually gave us Redux). There are many different styling libraries popping up and each has different tradeoffs. Two of the most popular are <a href="https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components">Glamorous</a> and <a href="https://github.com/robinpowered/glamorous-native">Styled Components</a>. The whole idea behind both of these libraries is that styling is a primary concern of the component, and therefore styling should be coupled with the component itself. We'll take a look at using Styled Component with React Native a little bit later.

# Flexbox Guide
https://youtu.be/TO20-Xp6R3c

## Getting Started with Flexbox
If you aren't familiar with flexbox you're in good company, because I'm not either. That's a joke.

Whenever I learn a new technology, I like to answer the question, ‚ÄúWhy does this specific technology exist?‚Äù With flexbox, the answer to this question may just be that creating an all-purpose layout with CSS can be quite cumbersome. The whole goal of flexbox is to create a more efficient way to "lay out, align, and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic". In a nutshell, flexbox is all about creating dynamic layouts.

The main idea of flexbox is that you give the parent element the ability to control the layout of all of their (immediate!) child elements rather than having each child element control its own layout. When you do this, the parent becomes a flex container while the child elements become flex items. An example of this is instead of having to float to the left all children of an element and add margin to each one, instead, you can just have the parent element specify to have all of its children be laid out in a row with even space between them. So, layout responsibilities move from the children to the parent. This allows for more fine tuned control over the layout of your app.

There's a lot of content in this section broken down into the following sections:

There's a lot of content in this section broken down into the following sections:

* Flexbox Axes
* Flex Direction
* Justify Content
    * Flex-Start
    * Center
    * Flex-End
    * Space-Between
    * Space-Around
* Align Items
    * Flex-Start
    * Center
    * Flex-End
    * Stretch
* Centering Content
* The Flex Property
* Aligning Individual Items

## Flexbox Axes
By far, the most important concept to understand when it comes to flexbox is that flexbox is all about different <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-plural-form-of-axis-1?redirected_qid=153694">axes<a>. You'll have a Main Axis and a Cross Axis.

![Main and Cross Axes](https://github.com/budostylz/ReactJS/blob/master/React%20Native/Styling%20%26%20Layout/main_cross_axes.PNG "Main and Cross Axes")

n React Native, by default, the Main Axis is vertical while the Cross Axis is horizontal. Everything from here on out is built upon this concept of a Main Axis and Cross Axis.

When I say "‚Ä¶which will align all the child elements along the Main Axis" that means that, by default, all the children of the parent element will be laid out vertically from top to bottom. If I say "‚Ä¶which will align the child elements along the Cross Axis" that means that, by default, all the children elements will be laid out horizontally from left to right.

The rest of flexbox is just deciding how you want to align, position, stretch, spread, shrink, center, wrap child elements along the Main and Cross axis.

Flex Direction
You'll notice that I was very deliberate in mentioning the "default behavior" when it comes to the Main Axis and Cross Axis. That's because you can actually change which Axis is Main and which is Cross. That brings us to our first flexbox property, flex-direction (or flexDirection in React Native).

flex-direction has two values:

* row
* column
By default, every element in React Native has the flexDirection: column declaration. When an element has a flex-direction of column, its Main Axis is vertical and its Cross Axis is horizontal, just as we saw in the image above. However, if you give an element a flexDirection: row declaration, the axes switch. The Main axis becomes horizontal, while the Cross axis becomes vertical. Again, this is crucial because your entire layout is dependent on these two axes.

![Flex Direction Row](https://github.com/budostylz/ReactJS/blob/master/React%20Native/Styling%20%26%20Layout/flex_direction_row.PNG "Flex Direction Row")

## Justify Content
Now is when things start getting fun. Let's dive into the different properties and values we can use to align child elements along these axes. Let's focus entirely on the Main Axis, first.

In order to specify how children align themselves along the Main Axis, you'll use the justifyContent property. justifyContent has five different values you can use in order to change how the children align themselves along the Main Axis.

* flex-start
* center
* flex-end
* space-around
* space-between

Woah. I just dropped lots of unfamiliar terms. I'll walk through each and every one of them though, so we're good üíÉüèΩ.

If you want to follow along (which I highly recommend you do), create a new React Native project called "FlexboxExamples" and swap out your App.js code with the following:

```javascript

import React, { Component } from 'react'
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, AppRegistry } from 'react-native'

class FlexboxExamples extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <View style={styles.box}/>
        <View style={styles.box}/>
        <View style={styles.box}/>
      </View>
    )
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
  },
  box: {
    height: 50,
    width: 50,
    backgroundColor: '#e76e63',
    margin: 10,
  }
})

export default FlexboxExamples;


```

Note that with the code above, the only thing we'll be changing is the styling in the container object in the styles StyleSheet object. Ignore flex: 1 for now.

![flex-start](https://github.com/budostylz/ReactJS/blob/master/React%20Native/Styling%20%26%20Layout/justify_content_flex_start.PNG "flex-start")

justifyContent: 'flex-start' will align every child element towards the start of the the Main Axis.

```javascript

container: {
  flex: 1,
  justifyContent: 'flex-start',
}

```

If you were still struggling with the importance of Main Axis and Cross Axis hopefully it just clicked. Because flexDirection defaults to column, and we're using justifyContent which targets the Main Axis, our child elements are going to align themselves towards the start of the Main Axis which is the top left and work their way down.

![center](https://github.com/budostylz/ReactJS/blob/master/React%20Native/Styling%20%26%20Layout/justify_content_center.PNG "center")

```javascript

container: {
  flex: 1,
  justifyContent: 'center',
}

```

![flex-end](https://github.com/budostylz/ReactJS/blob/master/React%20Native/Styling%20%26%20Layout/justify_content_flex_end.PNG "flex-end")

justifyContent: 'flex-end' will align every child element towards the end of the the Main Axis. ‚Äã

```javascript

container: {
  flex: 1,
  justifyContent: 'flex-end',
}

```
![space between](https://github.com/budostylz/ReactJS/blob/master/React%20Native/Styling%20%26%20Layout/justify_content_space_between.PNG "space between")

justifyContent: 'space-between' will align every child so that the space between each child is even along the Main Axis. ‚Äã

```javascript
container: {
  flex: 1,
  justifyContent: 'space-between',
}

```
![space around](https://github.com/budostylz/ReactJS/blob/master/React%20Native/Styling%20%26%20Layout/justify_content_space_around.PNG "space around")

justifyContent: 'space-around' will align every child element so that there is even space around each element along the Main Axis. ‚Äã

```javascript

container: {
  flex: 1,
  justifyContent: 'space-around',
}

```

Now I want you to think about what would happen if we changed the flexDirection of our container to row instead of the default value column? Instead of our Main Axis being vertical, it's going to be horizontal. That means any child elements are going to align themselves horizontally rather than vertically.

```javascript

container: {
  flex: 1,
  flexDirection: 'row',
  justifyContent: 'space-around',
}

```

![space around](https://github.com/budostylz/ReactJS/blob/master/React%20Native/Styling%20%26%20Layout/justify_content_space_around.PNG "space around")

Notice that all we changed was the value for flexDirection, and it drastically altered our layout. Now you're starting to see the real power of flexbox.


## Align Items (The Cross Axis)
Now let's turn our focus entirely to the Cross Axis. In order to specify how children align themselves along the Cross Axis, you'd use the align-items property.

You would think that alignItems has the exact same values as justifyContent. It's a reasonable guess, but you'd be wrong. This property has four different values you can use in order to change how the children align themselves among the Cross Axis.

* flex-start
* center
* flex-end
* stretch

![align items flex start](https://github.com/budostylz/ReactJS/blob/master/React%20Native/Styling%20%26%20Layout/align_items_flex_start.PNG "align items flex start")

alignItems: 'flex-start' will align every child element towards the start of the the Cross Axis. ‚Äã

```javascript

container: {
  flex: 1,
  alignItems: 'flex-start',
}

```

![align items center](https://github.com/budostylz/ReactJS/blob/master/React%20Native/Styling%20%26%20Layout/align_items_center.PNG "align items center")

alignItems: 'center' will align every child element towards the center of the Cross Axis. ‚Äã

```javascript

container: {
  flex: 1,
  alignItems: 'center',
}

```

![align items flex end](https://github.com/budostylz/ReactJS/blob/master/React%20Native/Styling%20%26%20Layout/align_items_flex_end.PNG "align items flex end")

alignItems: 'flex-end' will align every child element towards the end of the the Cross Axis. ‚Äã

```javascript

container: {
  flex: 1,
  alignItems: 'flex-end',
}

```

![align items flex end](https://github.com/budostylz/ReactJS/blob/master/React%20Native/Styling%20%26%20Layout/align_items_stretch.PNG "align items flex end")

alignItems: 'stretch' will stretch every child element along the Cross Axis as long as the child element does not have a specified height (flexDirection: row) or width (flexDirection: column). ‚Äã

```javascript

container: {
  flex: 1,
  alignItems: 'stretch',
},
box: {
  height: 50,
  backgroundColor: '#e76e63',
  margin: 10,
}

```

Just when you thought you were getting the hang of it, flexbox throws a wrench in your brain. Whenever you set alignItems to stretch, each child element is going to stretch the full width or height of the parent container as long as that child element doesn't have a width or a height. Notice in the box styling, I removed the width: 50 because flexDirection is set to column by default meaning that flex items will be stretching horizontally (since we're using alignItems).

To cement this home, what will our UI look like if I change our styling to this?

```javascript

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'stretch',
    flexDirection: 'row',
  },
  box: {
    width: 50,
    backgroundColor: '#e76e63',
    margin: 10,
  }
})

```
Notice I've changed the flexDirection to row, and I've added back in width: 50 and removed the height: 50.

![align items flex end](https://github.com/budostylz/ReactJS/blob/master/React%20Native/Styling%20%26%20Layout/align_items_flexdirection.PNG "align items flex end")



Let's break this down. First, the Main Axis is now running horizontally since we added flexDirection: row. This means that alignItems will be aligning the items along the vertical axis. Because we've removed the height of the child elements and added alignItems: stretch, those elements are going to stretch along the vertical axis for the entire length of their parent component, which in this case is the whole view.

Up until this point, we've only had one flex container or parent element. Don't get it twisted though; if you create more nested flex containers, the exact same logic above is going to be true for those child elements (flex items) but instead of being relative to the whole view (as in our example), they'll position themselves according to the their parent component. Your entire UI will be built upon nesting flex containers.

At this point, you're essentially a red belt in React Native styling TaeKwonDo. There are a few other flexbox features we need to look at, though.

You'll very quickly come to a realization that there are no percent-based styling in React Native. Though I agree it makes things a bit more difficult, everything you can do with percent-based styling you can do with flexbox. Remember the flex: 1 declaration we used in all the examples above? That's the property that's going to allow us to do it. Interestingly enough there's no exact comparison for this feature in flexbox on the web, but it is similar to flex-grow if you know what that does.

As we've seen over and over, flexbox is concerned with giving control to the parent element to handle the layout of its children elements. The flex property is a bit different as it allows child elements to specify their height or width in comparison to their sibling elements. The best way to explain flex is to look at some examples.

![centering content](https://github.com/budostylz/ReactJS/blob/master/React%20Native/Styling%20%26%20Layout/centering_content.PNG "centering content")

How would you implement that? Notice that our Main Axis is horizontal; this gives us a clue that we're using flexDirection: row. The boxes are in the center of both axes which means we're using justifyContent: 'center' and alignItems: 'center'.

```javascript

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    flexDirection: 'row',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  box: {
    width: 50,
    height: 50,
    backgroundColor: '#e76e63',
    margin: 10,
  }
})


```

![flex property](https://github.com/budostylz/ReactJS/blob/master/React%20Native/Styling%20%26%20Layout/flex_property.PNG "flex property")

In the above image, it's exactly the same layout -- but now the middle section is twice as wide as its siblings! This is what the flex property allows us to do. Here‚Äôs the code:

```javascript

class FlexboxExamples extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <View style={[styles.box, {flex: 1}]}/>
        <View style={[styles.box, {flex: 2}]}/>
        <View style={[styles.box, {flex: 1}]}/>
      </View>
    )
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    flexDirection: 'row',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  box: {
    width: 50,
    height: 50,
    backgroundColor: '#e76e63',
    margin: 10,
  }
})

export default FlexboxExamples;

```

Notice I didn't add any styles; I just made the middle sibling have flex: 2 while the other siblings have flex: 1. This basically says "make sure that the middle sibling is twice as large along the Main Axis as the first and third children". This is the reason why flex can replace percentages because usually a percent-based layout is just one where specific elements are relative to other elements, exactly like we're doing above. It's also important to note that if you place flex: 1 on an element, that element is going to take up as much space as its parent takes up. That's why in most of our examples above because we want our "layout area" to be the size of the parent, which in our examples was the whole viewport.

Let's go even deeper!

![align self flex-end](https://github.com/budostylz/ReactJS/blob/master/React%20Native/Styling%20%26%20Layout/align_self_flex_end.PNG "align self flex-end")

It's as if the first and third element are centered both vertically and horizontally, but that second element has a mind of its own and is using flex-end along the Cross Axis. To implement this, we'll need a way to have the child element override a specific positioning it received from its parent. Good news: that's exactly what alignSelf allows us to do! Notice it begins with align, so just like alignItems, it's going to position itself along the Cross Axis. It also has the exact same options as alignItems (flex-start, flex-end, center, stretch).

The code to implement the image above is:

```javascript

class FlexboxExamples extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <View style={styles.box}/>
        <View style={[styles.box, {alignSelf: 'flex-end'}]}/>
        <View style={styles.box}/>
      </View>
    )
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    flexDirection: 'row',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  box: {
    width: 50,
    height: 50,
    backgroundColor: '#e76e63',
    margin: 10,
  }
})

export default FlexboxExamples;

```

Note that all we've done is add alignSelf: flex-end to the second child element and that overrode what it was instructed to do by the parent (alignItems: 'center').

If you've made it all the way through this, great work! I realize that was a lot to cover but I hope it's helped you get up and running with styling (and specifically flexbox) on React Native.

## Summary
React Native leverages a version of flexbox to build component layout. This is primarily due to flexbox's ability to provide consistent layouts across different screen sizes.

Flexbox containers comprise of two axes: a main axis, as well as a cross axis. Some of the more critical properties to consider when building layouts with flexbox include flex-direction, justify-content, and align-items. React Native's implementation of flexbox _is_ a bit different, however. We'll see just how in the very next section!

# Layout in React Native
https://youtu.be/Yl69abRLGbY

## React Native's Flexbox Implementation
React Native implements flexbox for build layouts, but there are some key differences to keep in mind as you develop your applications. First, all containers in React Native are flex containers by default. Recall that in traditional CSS flexbox, you would normally define a flex container like so:

```javascript

/*example.css*/

.container {
  display: flex;
}

```

However, this is completely unnecessary in React Native! By default, everything is display: flex;. You can just use the defaults as they are, without adding different properties or writing extra code.

Another important distinction is how React Native handles flex-direction, a property that establishes the main axis (i.e., defining the direction in which flex items are placed). In web applications, items default to row. But since we're working on mobile devices, React Native sets the default to column, which lays out items vertically.

One more major difference you'll encounter is how the flex property is used. On the web, flex specifies how a flex item grows or shrinks to manage the space around it (along the main axis). In React Native, flex is generally used with flex items that are on the same level, but hold different flex values. For example:

## Other Differences
In addition to the above, here is a list of defaults in other common CSS properties that React Native applies to components:

```css

box-sizing: border-box;
position: relative;
align-items: stretch;
flex-shrink: 0;
align-content: flex-start;
border: 0 solid black;
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
min-width: 0;

```

## Platform API
Recall that React's approach to app development is "learn once, write anywhere." The goal is to use the same principles, technologies, and in the case of React Native -- the same code -- to develop applications. However, there may be cases that make sense to use distinct code for each mobile platform. For example, what if we wanted unique styling between iOS and Android visual components?

React Native gives us a convenient way to organize and separate code through the Platform API. Let's check out an example!

üí° Dimensions APIüí°
React Native also comes with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/dimensions.html">Dimensions</a>, which allows you to select window's width and height in the user's device!

First, make sure you pull the API from React Native:

    import { Dimensions } from 'react-native';

Then, you can simply grab the window sizes with the Dimensions API's get method:

  const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');

Feel free to use these measurements to, for example, plan how your <View>s will look.

## Summary
React Native uses flexbox to manage layout in mobile applications. However, there are some minor distinctions between the official flexbox specification (i.e., CSS on the web) and React Native's own implementation. Most of these distinctions are just differences in default settings.

Since differences also exist in how Android and iOS applications should look and feel, React Native also offers a Platform API, which we can leverage to style each platform independently.

In the next section, we'll take a look at some common "gotchas" and best practices when styling components.

# How Professionals Handle Styling
https://youtu.be/I3T17kupyv0

## Styling: Stylesheet vs. Inline
Earlier you were introduced to React Native‚Äôs StyleSheet API for creating ‚Äústylesheets‚Äù out of JavaScript objects. At first this approach may seem a little strange, but there are some reasons behind it. Primarily those reasons are code quality and performance. Let‚Äôs take a look at some comparisons in regards to code quality.

```javascript

<View style={{
  borderRadius: 4,
  borderWidth: 0.5,
  borderColor: '#d6d7da',
}}>
  <Text style={[
    {fontSize: 19, fontWeight: 'bold'}, 
    props.isActive && { color: 'red' }
  ]}>
    Welcome
  </Text>
</View>


```
Above we have some JSX for a pretty simple UI. Notice, that even though this UI is rather simple, the styling of it makes it rather messy. This is perhaps the biggest benefit to the StyleSheet API: by moving styles away from the render function, the code becomes easier to read and understand. Not only that, but naming the styles is a good way to make components a little more declarative. With the StyleSheet API, we can change the code above to now look like this:

```javascript

var styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    borderRadius: 4,
    borderWidth: 0.5,
    borderColor: '#d6d7da',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 19,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
  activeTitle: {
    color: 'red',
  },
});

<View style={styles.container}>
  <Text style={[styles.title, props.isActive && styles.activeTitle]} />
</View>

```

On top of quality benefits, there are also performance benefits as well. Making a stylesheet from a style object makes it possible to refer to it by ID instead of creating a new style object every render.

## Media Queries
One thing you may have noticed is that React Native (and specifically the StyleSheet API) doesn‚Äôt support <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries">media queries</a>. The reason for this is because, for the most part, you can design responsive grids with flexbox which will bypass the need to use media queries. In the rare case where flexbox just won‚Äôt work for your specific needs, you can use the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/dimensions.html">Dimensions</a> API which we covered earlier to get similar results.

## CSS in JS Libraries
Styling in React is going through a renaissance period right now just as Flux did a few years ago (which eventually gave us Redux). There are many different styling libraries popping up and each has different tradeoffs.

Two of the most popular are <a href="https://github.com/robinpowered/glamorous-native">Glamorous</a>and <a href="https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components">Styled Components</a>. The whole idea of both of these libraries is that styling is a primary concern of the component and because of that, should be coupled with the component itself.

Let‚Äôs take a look at not only the Styled Components library, but also how you‚Äôd use it with React Native.
