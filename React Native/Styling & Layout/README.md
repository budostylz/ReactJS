# CSS in JS
Before we jump into how CSS in JavaScript works, let's check out an example of some "normal" HTML and CSS:

```javascript
        <!-- index.css -->
        .avatar {
            border-radius: 5px;
            margin: 10px;
            width: 48px;
            height: 48px;
        }

        <!-- // index.html -->
        <div>
            <img class='avatar' src='https://tylermcginnis.com/tylermcginnis_glasses-300.png' />
        </div>

        Nothing too surprising! But since we're not using HTML or CSS files to build mobile apps -- how would this look in React Native?

        First, it important to know that all of the core components in React Native can accept a prop named style. One way we can leverage this prop is to provide styling to components with inline JavaScript objects:


        function Avatar ({ src }) {
            return (
                <View>
                    <Image
                        style={{borderRadius: 5, margin: 10, width: 48, height: 48}}
                        source={{uri: 'https://tylermcginnis.com/tylermcginnis_glasses-300.png'}}
                    />
                </View>
                );
            }
```

In the example above, the <Image> component receives two props: style and source. The value of style is just a plain old JavaScript object with borderRadius, margin, width, and height properties. Keep in mind that unlike CSS on the web, properties are written in camelCase (i.e., borderRadius in CSS in JS, but border-radius on the web).

This works, but things can get muddy quickly. Imagine if the inline object contained a dozen properties, or if we wanted the same style to apply to more than just one component! One way to keep your code DRY and reusable is to store the object in a variable:

```javascript
        const styles = {
            image: {
                borderRadius: 5,
                margin: 10,
                width: 48,
                height: 48
            }
        };

        function Avatar ({ src }) {
        return (
            <View>
            <Image
                style={styles.image}
                source={{uri: 'https://tylermcginnis.com/tylermcginnis_glasses-300.png'}}
            />
            </View>
        );
        }

It's a great way to clean things up a bit, but React Native goes a step further with its StyleSheet API. Check out the following example:

        import React from 'react';
        import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';

        export default class TextExample extends React.Component {
        render() {
            return (
            <View>
                <Text style={styles.greenLarge}>This is large green text!</Text>
                <Text style={styles.red}>This is smaller red text!</Text>
            </View>
            );
        }
        }

        const styles = StyleSheet.create({
            greenLarge: {
                color: 'green',
                fontWeight: 'bold',
                fontSize: 40
            },
            red: {
                color: 'red',
                padding: 30
            },
        });
```

Here, an object containing styles is passed into StyleSheet's create method. It looks similar to styling with a JavaScript object variable! However, using StyleSheet gives us a few benefits in terms of code quality and performance. We‚Äôll take a closer look later in this Lesson as well, but this is how the React Native docs describe it:

Code quality

* By moving styles away from the render function, you're making the code easier to understand.
* Naming the styles is a good way to add meaning to the low-level components in the render function.

Performance

* Making a stylesheet from a style object makes it possible to refer to it by ID instead of creating a new style object every time.
* It also allows to send the style only once through the bridge. All subsequent uses are going to refer to an id (not implemented yet).

Another benefit is that StyleSheet validates the content within the style object as well. This means that should there be any errors in any properties or values in your style objects, the console will throw an error during compilation instead of at runtime.

üí° Additional Stylingüí°
If you wanted to implement more than one style to a component, the style prop can accept styles as an array:

        <Text style={[styles.red, styles.greenLarge]}>This will be red, then greenLarge</Text>

The above <Text> component will render large green text, as the last style in the array will take precedence. This is a great way to inherit styles!

üí° Libraries for CSS in JSüí°
Styling in React is going through a renaissance period right now just as Flux did a few years ago (which eventually gave us Redux). There are many different styling libraries popping up and each has different tradeoffs. Two of the most popular are <a href="https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components">Glamorous</a> and <a href="https://github.com/robinpowered/glamorous-native">Styled Components</a>. The whole idea behind both of these libraries is that styling is a primary concern of the component, and therefore styling should be coupled with the component itself. We'll take a look at using Styled Component with React Native a little bit later.

# Flexbox Guide

## Getting Started with Flexbox
If you aren't familiar with flexbox you're in good company, because I'm not either. That's a joke.

Whenever I learn a new technology, I like to answer the question, ‚ÄúWhy does this specific technology exist?‚Äù With flexbox, the answer to this question may just be that creating an all-purpose layout with CSS can be quite cumbersome. The whole goal of flexbox is to create a more efficient way to "lay out, align, and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic". In a nutshell, flexbox is all about creating dynamic layouts.

The main idea of flexbox is that you give the parent element the ability to control the layout of all of their (immediate!) child elements rather than having each child element control its own layout. When you do this, the parent becomes a flex container while the child elements become flex items. An example of this is instead of having to float to the left all children of an element and add margin to each one, instead, you can just have the parent element specify to have all of its children be laid out in a row with even space between them. So, layout responsibilities move from the children to the parent. This allows for more fine tuned control over the layout of your app.

There's a lot of content in this section broken down into the following sections:

* Justify Content

    * Space-Around
* Align Items
    * Flex-Start
    * Center
    * Flex-End
    * Stretch

* The Flex Property
* Aligning Individual Items

## Flexbox Axes
By far, the most important concept to understand when it comes to flexbox is that flexbox is all about different <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-plural-form-of-axis-1?redirected_qid=153694">axes<a>. You'll have a Main Axis and a Cross Axis.
